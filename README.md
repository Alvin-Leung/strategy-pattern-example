# strategy-pattern-example

The goal of this repo is to offer an example of the strategy pattern that more easily relates to real-world situations. The example consists of a design for a user profile export class that exports profile data locally to XML and other formats.

The accompanying blog post discussing this code can be found [here](https://gooddevbaddev.com/2020/06/15/strategy-pattern-an-example/).
